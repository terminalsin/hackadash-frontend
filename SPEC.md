We are creating a hackathon hosting platform. This allows users to create hackathons and view submissions etc. The focus is only on people being able to sponsor.

Part 1: Basic flow
User should be able to create a hackathon. When he creates a hackathon, he assigned the role "Organiser". 

Organisers can:
- invite people to a hackathon using a unique 4 pin code (they will be assigned the role "guest")
- invite more people to be organisers in the hackathon (role "organiser")
- create sponsors for the hackathon (more detailed later)
- invite sponsors employees to the hackathon (role "sponsor" attached to a company from the sponsor list)
- modify the hackathon
- start the hackathon
- view submissions
- add prizes
- Modify submission states
- View reported issues

Guests can:
- Create or join a team
- Edit the team they are in
- Leave a team
- Report an issue

Teams can (aka user in a team):
- View their team
- Edit their team
- Create a singular submission
- View or edit that submission

A submission has:
- A title
- A description
- A link to a github
- A link or file to a presentation
- A state (draft, ready to demo, presented)
- A list of sponsors used

Sponsors can:
- add additional prizes
- view submissions which use their tool

Hackathon consists of:
- Teams
- Title
- Description
- Image
- Location
- Time
- Organisers
- Sponsors
- Prizes
